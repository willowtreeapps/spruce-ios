/// The basic `SortFunction`. Use this sort function if you want to animate in all views at the same time and give an `interObjectDelay` of `0.0`. Note that this `SortFunction` will animate the views based on the order they were added to the animation view. This means that the way the views are sorted in the `subviews` array is the way that they will be sorted by this `SortFunction`. 
public struct DefaultSortFunction: SortFunction {
    
    public init() {
        
    }
    
    public func weights(for view: UIView, recursiveDepth: Int) -> [WeightedView] {
        let subviews = view.spruce.subviews(withRecursiveDepth: recursiveDepth)
        var currentWeight: Double = 0.0
        var weightedViews: [WeightedView] = []
        for subview in subviews {
            let timedView = WeightedView(spruceView: subview, weight: currentWeight)
            weightedViews.append(timedView)
